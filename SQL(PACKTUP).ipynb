    "Understanding Data\n",
    "For most companies, storing and retrieving data is a day-to-day activity, and based on the nature\n",
    "of the work. Based on how data is stored, we can broadly classify data as structured or unstructured.\n",
    "Unstructured data, simply put, is data that is not well-organized. Documents, PDFs, and videos fall \n",
    "into this categoryâ€”they contain a mixture of different data types (text, images, audio, video, and \n",
    "                                                                   so on) that have no consistent \n",
    "relationship between them. Media and publishing are examples of industries that deal with \n",
    "unstructured data such as this.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this book, our focus will be more on structured data. Structured data is data that is organized\n",
    "according to a consistent structure. As such, structured data can be easily organized into tables.\n",
    "Thanks to its consistent organization, working with structured data is easier and it can be \n",
    "processed\n",
    "more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following table:\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1.1: An example student's database table\n",
    "For each row, there is a clear relationship; a given student takes a particular subject and achieves \n",
    "a specific score in that subject. The columns are also known as fields, while the rows are known as\n",
    "records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data that is presented in tabular form can be stored in a relational database. Relational databases,\n",
    "as the name suggests, store data that has a certain relationship with another piece of data. \n",
    "A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a system that's used to manage relational data. \n",
    "SQL works very well with relational data. Popular RDBMSs include Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and \n",
    "Oracle. Throughout this book, we will be working with MySQL; however, the examples in this book can\n",
    "work with Microsoft SQL Server as well. We can use various SQL commands to work with data in \n",
    "relational databases. We'll have a brief look at them in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Overview of Basic SQL Commands\n",
    "SQL (often pronounced \"sequel\") stands for Structured Query Language. A query in SQL is constructed\n",
    "using different commands. These commands are classified into what are called sublanguages of SQL.\n",
    "Even if you think you know them already, give this a read to see if these seem more relatable to you.\n",
    "There are five sublanguages in SQL, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Definition Language (DDL): As the name suggests, the commands that fall under this category \n",
    "    work with defining either a table, a database, or anything within. Any command that talks about\n",
    "    creating something in SQL is part of DDL. Some examples of such commands are CREATE, ALTER, and\n",
    "    DROP.\n",
    "The following table shows the DDL commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1.2: DDL commands \n",
    "Data Manipulation Language (DML): In DML, you do not deal with the containers of data but the data \n",
    "    itself. When you must update the data itself, or perform calculations or operations on it, you\n",
    "    use the DML. The commands that form part of this language (or sublanguage) include INSERT, UPDATE,\n",
    "    MERGE, and DELETE.\n",
    "DML allows you to work on the data without modifying the container or stored procedures. A copy of\n",
    "the data is created and the operations are performed on this copy of the data. These operations are\n",
    "performed using the DML. The following table shows the DML commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1.3: DML commands \n",
    "Data Control Language (DCL): When we sit back and think about what the word control means in the \n",
    "    context of data, we think of allowing and disallowing actions on the data. In SQL terms, or in\n",
    "    terms of data, this is about authorization. Therefore, the commands that fall in this category\n",
    "    are GRANT and REVOKE. They control access to the data. The following table explains them:\n",
    "Figure 1.4: DCL commands \n",
    "\n",
    "Transaction Control Language (TCL): Anything that makes a change to the data is called a transaction.\n",
    "    When you perform a data manipulation operation, the manipulation happens to data in a temporary \n",
    "    location and not the table/database itself. The result is shown after the operation. In order to\n",
    "    write or remove something from the database, you need to use a command to ask the database to \n",
    "    update itself with the new content. Applying these changes to the database is called a\n",
    "    transaction and is done using the TCL. The commands associated with this language are COMMIT\n",
    "    and ROLLBACK. The following table explains these commands in detail: Figure 1.5: TCL commands \n",
    "Data Query Language (DQL): The final part of this section regarding the classification of commands\n",
    "    is the DQL. This is used to fetch data from the database with the SELECT command. It's explained \n",
    "    in detail in the following table:\n",
    "Figure 1.6: DQL command\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll look at these queries in detail in later chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating Databases\n",
    "An interesting point to note is that the create database command is not part of the regular SQL\n",
    "standard. However, it is supported by almost all database products today. The create database\n",
    "statement is straightforward. You just need to issue a database name along with the command, \n",
    "followed by a semicolon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by creating a simple example database. We'll call it studentdemo. To create the\n",
    "studentdemo database with the default configuration, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "create database studentdemo;\n",
    "To run this statement, click the Execute button (shaped like a lightning bolt):\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1.7: Creating the studentdemo database \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Action Output pane, the successful completion of a command will appear. You will also\n",
    "be able to see the newly created database in the Schemas tab of the Navigator pane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:  SQL is not case sensitive. This implies CREATE TABLE studentdemo; is the same as create\n",
    "    table studentdemo;.\n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot have multiple databases with the same name. If you try to run the query again, you'll \n",
    "get the following error:\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1.8: Error message displayed in the case of a database with the same name as another database \n",
    "The Use of Semicolons\n",
    "As you may have noticed, there's a semicolon, ;, at the end of the statement as an indication that\n",
    "that's the end of that statement. It depends on the database system you are using; some of them \n",
    "require a semicolon at the end of each statement and some don't, but you can still add it without \n",
    "worrying about the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:  In general, it's good practice to use a semicolon at the end of a statement as it could play\n",
    "    a significant role when we have multiple SQL statements or while writing a function or a trigger.\n",
    "    This will be explained in more detail in the upcoming chapters. Throughout this book, we will use\n",
    "    semicolons at the end of each statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Types in SQL\n",
    "Like every other programming language, SQL also has data types. Every piece of data that is entered \n",
    "into a database must comply with the data types and their formats. This implies that any data that \n",
    "you store is either a number, a character, or some other data type. Those are the basic data types.\n",
    "There are some special data types as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, \"00:43 on Monday, 1 April 2019\" is a combination of letters, numbers, and punctuation. \n",
    "However, when we see something like this, we immediately start thinking of the day. A data type is \n",
    "the type of value that can be stored in a system, examples of which are INTEGER, FLOATING POINT, \n",
    "\n",
    "CHARACTER, and STRING, combinations of these, such as DATETIME.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there's a large amount of data types, most languages classify data types. Here, we will go \n",
    "through some of the most common ones. The idea here is to get you acquainted with the data types,\n",
    "not to give you a complete rundown of themas this would overwhelm you with hardly any significant\n",
    "returns. Moreover, once the concept is clear, you will be able to adapt to the rest of the data \n",
    "types\n",
    "with little effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the interest of better data integrity and modeling, it is critical to select the right data type \n",
    "for the situation. It may seem trivial when the database is small, but with a larger database, it\n",
    "becomes difficult to manage. As a programmer, it is your responsibility to model your data in the \n",
    "right way.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to keep this simple, let's broadly classify the data types into five categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric data types: Numeric data types include everything that involves numbers, such as integers\n",
    "    (small/big), floating- and fixed-point decimal numbers, and real numbers. Here are some of the\n",
    "    most common ones: Figure 1.9: Numeric data types \n",
    "Fixed and varying length characters and text: Performance is key when selecting either fixed or\n",
    "    variable-length characters. When you know that a certain piece of data will be of a fixed number\n",
    "    of characters, use the fixed width. For example, if you know that the employee code will always\n",
    "    be of 4 characters, you can use CHAR. When you are unsure of the number of characters, use the \n",
    "    variable width. If a certain column holds only six characters, you are better off specifying it\n",
    "    so that space used will be limited. By doing this, you will get better performance by not using \n",
    "    up more resources than required. If you are unsure of the width, you don't want to be limited\n",
    "    by\n",
    "    the total width. Therefore, you should ideally use character types of varying lengths. An \n",
    "    example of this can be a person's first name, where the length of the name is not fixed.\n",
    "Note: You can use CHAR with varying lengths of characters (VARCHAR) as well. For instance, in \n",
    "    a field that accepts up to six characters, you can enter data that is three characters long. \n",
    "    However, you would be leaving the other three-character spaces unused, which will be \n",
    "    right-padded\n",
    "    , meaning that the remaining spaces will be reserved as actual spaces. When the data is\n",
    "    retrieved, these trailing spaces will be trimmed. If you don't want them to be trimmed, you\n",
    "    can set a flag in SQL that tells SQL to reserve the spaces and not trim them during retrieval.\n",
    "    There are situations where you would need to do this using the TRIM string function, \n",
    "    for example,\n",
    "    to enhance data security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unicode characters and string data types are different. They are prefixed with N, such as NCHAR, \n",
    "NVARCHAR, and NTEXT. Also, note that not all SQL implementations support Unicode data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Unicode character data types consume twice the storage space compared to non-Unicode character\n",
    "    data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other character-based data type is TEXT. This can store textual data up to a certain limit, \n",
    "which may vary with the system. For instance, MS SQL supports text up to 2 GB in size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary data types: Binary forms of data are also allowed in SQL. For instance, an IMAGE would be \n",
    "    an object of binary form. Similarly, you have BINARY and VARBINARY data types.\n",
    "Miscellaneous data types: Miscellaneous data types include most of the now-popular data types,\n",
    "    such as Binary Large Object (BLOB), Character Large Object (CLOB), XML, and JSON. We have\n",
    "    included DATE, TIME, and DATETIME as well in this class.\n",
    "Character and binary large objects include types such as files. For instance, a film stored on\n",
    "Netflix is a binary large object. So would be an application package such as an EXE or an MSI, \n",
    "or other types of files such as PDFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:  SQL Server 2016 supports JSON. JSON Unicode character representation uses NVARCHAR/NCHAR \n",
    "    or ANSI VARCHAR/CHAR for non-Unicode strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "MySQL version 5.7.8 supports a native JSON data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proprietary types: In the real world, there is hardly a pure SQL implementation that is favored \n",
    "    by enterprises. Different businesses have different requirements, and to cater to these \n",
    "    requirements, SQL implementations have created their own data types. For instance, Microsoft \n",
    "    SQL has MONEY as a data type.\n",
    "Not all data types are supported by all vendors. For instance, Oracle's implementation of SQL does \n",
    "not support DATETIME, while MySQL does not support CLOB. Therefore, the flavor of SQL is an\n",
    "important\n",
    "consideration when designing your database schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned previously, this is not an exhaustive list of all data types. Your flavor of SQL\n",
    "will have its own supporting set of data types. Read the documentation that comes with the product\n",
    "kit to find out what it supportsâ€”as a programmer or a SQL administrator, it is you who decides what \n",
    "is necessary. This book will empower you to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The size limits illustrated in Figure 1.9 are only indicative. Just as different flavors of \n",
    "databases may have different data types, they may have different limits as well. The documentation \n",
    "that accompanies the product you plan to use will have this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating Simple Tables\n",
    "After creating the database, we want to create a table The create table statement is part of the SQL\n",
    "standard. The create table statement allows you to configure your table, your columns, and all your\n",
    "relations and constraints. Along with the create table command, you're going to pass the table name\n",
    "and a list of column definitions. At the minimum for every column, you must provide the column name \n",
    "and the data type the column will hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you want to add a table called Student to the previously created database, studentdemo, \n",
    "and you want this table to contain the following details:\n",
    "\n",
    "Student name: The student's full name.\n",
    "Student ID: A value to identify each student uniquely.\n",
    "Grade: Each student is graded as A, B, or C based on their performance.\n",
    "Age: The age of the student.\n",
    "Course: The course they are enrolled on.\n",
    "To achieve this, we need to complete a two-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "To set the current database as studentdemo, enter the following code in the new query tab:Figure \n",
    "    1.10: Switching from the default database to our database \n",
    "You can open a new query tab, by clicking File | New Query Tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a table Student within studentdemo with the following columns:\n",
    "create table Student\n",
    "(\n",
    "    StudentID      CHAR (4),\n",
    "    StudentName VARCHAR (30),\n",

    "    course      VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    PRIMARY KEY (StudentID)\n",
    ");\t\t\n",
    "The preceding code creates a Student table with the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "StudentID will contain four character values. 'S001', 'ssss', and 'SSSS' are all valid inputs \n",
    "and can be stored in the StudentID field.\n",
    "grade will just contain a single character. 'A', 'F', 'h', '1', and 'z' are all valid inputs.\n",
    "StudentName will contain variable-length values, which can be 30 characters in size at most. 'John',\n",
    "'Parker', 'Anna', 'Cleopatra', and 'Smith' are all valid inputs.\n",
    "course will also contain variable-length values, which can be 50 characters in size at most.\n",
    "age will be an integer value. 1, 34, 98, 345 are all valid values.\n",
    "StudentID is defined as the primary key. This implies that all the values in the StudentID field\n",

    "\n",
    "be unique, and no value can be null. You can uniquely identify any record in the Student table\n",

Although we did insert some data into the tables, we didn't quite get into the specifics of managing the data within the database.

For example, an employee working for a company might want to change their official number from what was updated earlier. A product that is no longer manufactured needs to be removed from the list of products available. MySQL provides some commands we can implement to make changes to the database, which will be covered in this chapter. In this chapter, we will fill the tables we created in the previous \n",

    "The INSERT Operation\n",
    "The INSERT operation inserts a record within a table. We have already used the insert operation in the previous chapter, however, in this chapter, we are looking at it in more detail. The following are some important points about the INSERT operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not always essential to provide data for every single column when performing an INSERT operation. The columns can be left blank unless there is a constraint that forbids it. Some columns may even have default or system-generated values.\n",
    "You should not alter the system-generated values.\n",
    "The column values must match the order, data type, and size requirements.\n",
    "The values to be inserted into the table must be enclosed in quotes in the case of strings, date-time, and characters. Numbers should not be enclosed in quotes.\n",
    "If you do not specify the column names in the INSERT statement, your record should have a value for all the columns. Also, you should maintain the sequence of columns in the values.\n",
    "You can only insert values into one table at a time because INSERT INTO accepts only one table name as the table name argument.\n",
    "Performing a Simple INSERT\n",
    "As we have seen previously, the INSERT statement begins with INSERT INTO, followed by the table name. Next, you specify the names of the columns. It is mandatory to insert data into all the columns that require information (for example, columns that are specified as NOT NULL, or a column that is selected as the primary key).\n",
    "\n",
    "Blank columns need not be provided with data using the INSERT statement. Also, there may be columns with default values; these don't need to be provided with data either, unless it's necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've specified the names of the columns, you can use the VALUES clause to enter the values for those columns. In other words, you cannot specify the name of a column and then not provide it with data. If you do not wish to insert data into a column, then do not specify the column name in the INSERT INTO statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is as straightforward as it seems. This way, you insert one row or record into the table. However, in many cases, it is recommended to use the UPDATE operation along with the SET keyword to insert rows because the process is more efficient.\n",

    "Multiple Inserts\n",
    "In Exercise 2.01, Inserting Data into a Table, we saw how simple it is to perform a single row insert within a table. You specify the names of the columns and the rows, and that does the job. However, you may want to insert more than one row in a single statement in the interest of efficiency. This can be done by either explicitly specifying the values for multiple rows in the VALUES clause or by using a SELECT statement. With the SELECT statement, you are essentially inserting values into one table by collecting data from one or more other tables. Again, we saw this previously when we wanted to populate table in Chapter 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through another exercise to specify default values. Specifying a default value is simple; all you must do is use the DEFAULT keyword and specify the default value or a function that gets you the default value.\n",

We will also assume that every department has a record of the date that it was established. You are required to define your table accordingly. In this case, we will need a default value for the other columns in the database. Let's go through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "We already have a table called department, but it does not have a column to capture the established date. We will therefore drop the department table first and then create a new table. This allows us to overwrite it. The syntax for this is DROP TABLE IF EXISTS:\n",

If you would like to control the values, you need to alter the table to reset the auto-increment value before inserting the values in the identity columns.\n",

    "The DELETE statement deletes one or more rows within a table. Like the INSERT operations, DELETE also works only on a single table at a time. A deletion operation should be performed very carefully because deletion is permanent. Many database tools require you to add a WHERE clause to the DELETE FROM statement. When performing these deletion operations, which require a WHERE clause, and you would like to delete all the rows in a table, you could work around this by using a condition that is true for all the rows in the table.\n",

    "Let's continue with a simple example. Suppose we have a table called department within a database. Imagine that you would like to set the modified date for each of the departments to the current dateâ€”in other words, we are going to change the modified date on all the rows.

    "#NORMALIZATIONOverview\n",
    "This lesson teaches you to maintain data integrity using the concepts of normalization and how you can connect tables together using keys and relationships. We will also look at some solid theory that back most database designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "In the previous two chapters, we looked at different aspects of a database. We provided an overview of the points to be considered while setting up a database. One of the key aspects we focused on was data integrity. We now know why data consistency is important. A step toward achieving better data integrity is database normalization. In this chapter, we will take a detailed look at achieving data consistency through normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous two chapters, we learned about the relational model of data. We saw that a database can contain any number of tables. These tables are connected to each other using a relation. This relation is usually established between the selected columns across tables using something called a foreign key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding that the relational model and data integrity are critical when working with data in business, we will take a look at the concept of normalization. Setting up the data model with constraints in mind and optimizing data management is more of an art than science. You can summarize the relational model as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "A database server can contain many databases.\n",
    "Databases are collections of user-defined tables and system objects.\n",
    "Tables are collections of entities (rows) and attributes (columns).\n",
    "Tables can be used in conjunction with logical, mathematical, and summary operations.\n",
    "Tables can refer to other tables using a key.\n",
    "In order to enforce data integrity, we use primary keys and foreign keys. These are called referential constraints. Referential constraints are important internal database objects that help maintain data integrity.\n",

    "Primary Key Constraints\n",
    "A primary key constraint on a column instructs the database engine to keep the entries in a column unique. For example, if we were to create a table with information about all the human beings on Earth, we could use the tongue print of human beings as unique identification. If tongue prints were in a column, it would be the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to have a duplicate tongue print; however, it is rare. In such a case, you could create a primary key across multiple columns. Therefore, you could combine the tongue print, fingerprint, and the retinal signature to make a primary key. In such a case, the combination of these values in these columns should be unique across the table. In other words, there may be a duplicate tongue print, a duplicate fingerprint, and a duplicate retinal signature in the tableâ€”the database engine will allow that. However, there cannot be a duplicate combination of all three. Alternatively, there can be no two human beings whose tongue prints, fingerprints, and retinal signatures exactly match. This is called a composite primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key Constraints\n",
    "Let's look at this in the context of a primary key. When this primary key is referenced by a column in another table, this primary key becomes the foreign key of the other table. For example, consider the previously created databse PACKT_ONLINE_SHOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS PACKT_ONLINE_SHOP; \n",
    "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS PACKT_ONLINE_SHOP; \n",
    "USE PACKT_ONLINE_SHOP; \n",
    "CREATE TABLE Customers \n",
    "( \n",
    "    CustomerID INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, \n",
    "    FirstName CHAR(50) NOT NULL, \n",
    "    LastName CHAR(50) NOT NULL, \n",
    "    Address CHAR(250) NULL, \n",
    "    Email CHAR(200) NULL, \n",
    "    Phone CHAR(50) NULL, \n",
    "    Notes VARCHAR(750) NULL, \n",
    "    BalanceNotes VARCHAR(750) NULL, \n",
    "    PRIMARY KEY (CustomerID) \n",
    "); \n",
    "CREATE TABLE Orders \n",
    "( \n",
    "    OrderID INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, \n",
    "    CustomerID INT NOT NULL, \n",
    "    OrderNumber CHAR(50) NOT NULL, \n",
    "    OrderDate DATETIME NOT NULL, \n",
    "    ShipmentDate DATETIME NULL, \n",
    "    OrderStatus CHAR(10) NULL, \n",
    "    Notes VARCHAR(750) NULL, \n",
    "PRIMARY KEY (OrderID), \n",
    " FOREIGN KEY FK_Customer_CustomerID(CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID) \n",
    "); \n",
    "Each customer can place one or more orders. Each order can be for one or more products. Each order belongs to only one customer. When the database is designed, the relationship is established between the customers and the orders with a one-to-many relationship. There is also a relationship between orders and products, with a cardinality ratio of many-to-many (because one order can contain many products, and many copies of one product can be sold through many orders). The Orders table contains the CustomerID column, which refers to the CustomerID of the Customers table. The CustomerID field (or column) in the Customers table is the primary key, but it is the foreign key for the Orders table. The FOREIGN KEY clause specifies the foreign key using the REFERENCES clause. In this context, Customers could be considered the parent table and Orders could be considered the child.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: MySQL automatically creates an index corresponding to the foreign key called foreign_key_name. SQL Server does not create a corresponding index when a foreign key constraint is created. SQL Server automatically creates an index when a primary key constraint is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few points that you need to remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key always refers to a primary key.\n",
    "A table can have multiple foreign keys.\n",
    "The INSERT command only operates on those rows of the child table for which corresponding rows exist in the parent table.\n",
    "The DELETE command only operates on the rows from the parent table for which there are no corresponding records in the child table.\n",
    "Consider a scenario where someone is purchasing a book or a course from the Packt store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the OrderItems table:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE OrderItems \n",
    "( \n",
    "    OrderItemID INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, \n",
    "    OrderID INT NOT NULL, \n",

    "    Quantity INT NOT NULL, \n",
    "    UnitPrice DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL, \n",
    "    Discount DECIMAL(10, 2) NULL, \n",
    "    Notes VARCHAR(750) NULL, \n",
    "    PRIMARY KEY (OrderItemID) \n",
    "); \n",
    "Note: The preceding code makes use of the DECIMAL data type. The syntax for this is DECIMAL(p, s), where p is the precision (the total number of digits that can be stored in the number, before and after the decimal point) and s is the scale (the number of digits that can come after the decimal point). In the example, DECIMAL(10, 2) can store a total of 10 digits, including 2 after the decimal point.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is OrderItemID, which represents the ID of the item within an order, which is automatically incremented. Then, we have OrderID, ProductID, Quantity, UnitPrice, Discount, and Notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "OrderItemID is independent of this table in this case and could very much be the primary key since every item in an order is unique. However, there is a ProductID, which should ideally refer to the store inventory. This inventory could be called Products and would be a different table. Quantity is independent as well, but this is so arbitrary that no constraint could be placed on it other than NOT NULL. The UnitPrice field should also refer to the inventory because it changes with the product, and not with orders. Discount should also refer to another table altogether (you will see why when we discuss normalization).\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering this, ProductID should be the primary key of the Products table as it is unique across the store. Given that, the ProductID within the OrderItems table should be the foreign key, referring to the ProductID within Products. Let's see how we can set this up in the table:\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE OrderItems \n",
    "ADD FOREIGN KEY (ProductID) REFERENCES Products(ProductID); \n",
    "To drop a foreign key, you can use the ALTER TABLE statement:\n",
    "ALTER TABLE <table_name> \n",
    "DROP FOREIGN KEY <constraint_name>;\n",
    "In the context of our example, the syntax will be as follows:\n",
    "ALTER TABLE OrderItems \n",
    "DROP FOREIGN KEY ProductID \n",
    "Note: You can have zero or more foreign keys in a table. Each foreign key in a table can refer to one or more columns in any arbitrary table in the database, depending on the requirements.\n",

    "Preserving Data Integrity\n",
    "Preserving data integrity is simpler than it sounds. If you set the data model correctly, it's not much of a challenge to preserve data integrity. Nothing in the real world is foolproof; however, a tight data integrity model will ensure minimal exceptions. Here is a little checklist:\n",
    "\n",
    "Validate input: Set up input validation in the fields that are critical to decisions and prone to errors. You can do this at the application level, of course, but it is good practice to set this up at the database level as well. Validate the input when it arrives.\n",
    "Validate data: Ensure that you check the data when performing any form of operations. Your data processes should not be corrupted themselves. Check that your processes are working as intended.\n",
    "Remove duplicate data: Sensitive data from a secure database can easily find a home in a document, an email, a spreadsheet, or in shared folders that more individuals than necessary have access to. It is important to check for these stray or duplicate entities and clean them up.\n",
    "Types of Data Integrity\n",
    "Let's look at the different types of data integrity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Entity integrity: This defines each row as unique within the table. No two rows can have the same name. To achieve this, a primary key can be defined. This field contains a unique identifierâ€”no two rows can contain the same unique identifier.\n",
    "Referential integrity: Referential integrity is about relationships. When two or more tables have a relationship, we must ensure that the value of the foreign key always matches the value of the primary key, otherwise the record is orphaned.\n",
    "Referential integrity prevents adding records to a related table if there is no associated record in the primary or parent table, changing values in a primary table that can result in orphaned records in a related table, and deleting records from a primary table if there are matching related records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Domain integrity: This is primarily concerned with the validity of entries for a given column. It is important to select the appropriate data type for a column and set the appropriate constraints to define the data format or restrict the range of possible values.\n",
    "User-defined integrity: There are cases when you can apply business rules to the database. These rules may not have been covered by the three integrity types. User-defined integrity helps you to enforce your own rules to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "Take a break now and let all the information you've looked at a sink in a little. Next, we will dive into the concept of normalization and look at its different forms. We will see how normalization helps us achieve data integrity. We will work on a real-world example that we urge you to actively think about. You are here to learn about database management, and you came here on your own. It is time to show that passion in full.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Concept of Normalization\n",
    "Suppose we have a piece of software in our enterprise called Enterprise Server Manager that manages all the computers. The Enterprise Server Manager (ESM) has information about what computers we have, the operating system they run on, the version of the operating system, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, each server works for one or more teams. The respective teams have all the authority on these servers, along with being responsible for them. Imagine that you want the heads of the teams tagged as the owners of the servers. The server entries should contain the employee IDs, the names, the designations, and the department names of these owners. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3.1: ESM Agent detailsThe preceding table has all the information we need and the data looks consistent for now, right? Jon Doe's information is being repeated, though. Is that an issue?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that Jon Doe leaves the organization and Jim Doe replaces him. Now, imagine that this table has 4,000 entries and Jon Doe owns 300 servers. To change the owner of the servers, you may think of replacing the names in the table using the following query:\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE ServerInfo SET Name='Jim Doe' WHERE employeeName='Jon Doe';\n",
    "Now, Jim Doe joins the organization, and four servers get assigned to him. He is part of the Network team. After you make the changes to the table, you realize that you did not update the employee ID, designation, or the department for the entries that had Jon Doe, and without looking at the data, someone unknowingly runs the following query:\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE ServerInfo SET EmployeeId='79247' WHERE employeeName='Jim Doe';\n",
    "Do you think there is a problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "No: The designation for Jim Doe will be the same as Jon Doe, and so will the department. \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes: There are two individuals with the name Jim Doe, and now, they both have the same employee ID, which is wrong. This second individual tries to fix this issue as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE ServerInfo SET EmployeeId='79254', Designation='Network Specialist' WHERE employeeName='Jim Doe' and Department='Network';\n",
    "Did you observe how error-prone even this simple table is? What happens when you have 80 columns in a table and you try to update data this way? In the real world, the ESM Agent table has tens of columns, and so does the user information table in the Active Directory (an identity and access management system in an enterprise).\n",
    "\n",
    "How about if we have one entry per person and have all the servers they own listed in one single column?\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3.2: ESM Agent detailsDo you think we still have a problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes: What happens when the number of servers Jon Doe owns is 300? It is not a problem yet. Consider that all the MBSVR servers (and there are 28 of them) are replaced by new MBSVR servers with new names. What would your update operation be like?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's summarize the disadvantages of the above-mentioned scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintenance of the data becomes tedious, like all the activities we did when Jim Doe replaced Jon Doe.\n",
    "When we changed the name and nothing else in the table, and another Jim Doe joined the Network team, we observed inconsistency in the data.\n",
    "When we had to go through three steps to fix data in a table with a mere six columns and four rows, imagine the work required when dealing with thousands of records of data. We had to update four columns when one individual replaced another.\n",
    "Most of all, four of the columns in two rows had the same data. What happens when the number of rounds is in the thousands and the size of the table grows more than necessary?\n",
    "One important aspect of this is that if you make the server information and owner information dependent on a single table, you will find empty values in the cases of users who do not own any servers.\n",
    "If you delete all the servers owned by an individual, you will also end up deleting that individual's information unintentionally.\n",
    "Can you handle this situation better? Let's create two tables. The first one is the server information table:\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3.3: Server information tableThe second is the employee information table:\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3.4: Employee information tableLet's assume that our IAM application manages the second table. If Hans Doe replaces Jim Doe, the Team Lead, at a later point, the second table will get all the necessary information about Hans Doe when the Human Resources team processes Hans' hiring. All you would have to do then is replace the OwnerId information in the server information table with a single query:\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE ServerInfo SET OwnerId='79482' WHERE OwnerId='79247';\n",
    "What if you need to get a table that's identical to the first table, as we saw at the beginning of this chapter? We can use the following query:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT s.Servername, s.OperatingSystem, u.EmployeeId, u.Name, u.Designation, u.Department\n",
    "FROM ServerInfo s\n",

    "\n",
    "We have circled back to the point where we spoke about relational databases and its importance in the world of data. If you look at the preceding two tables, you will see that they are two tables of a relational database, where there is a relationship established between the two tables based on the foreign key, which is OwnerId in the ServerInfo table.

    "First Normal Form (1NF)\n",
    "What we saw in the solution for this situation is called the first normal form. Why? Because it adheres to the following four rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "Every column must be single-valued\n",
    "The data type of all the data in any column should be uniform\n",
    "Every column should have a unique name\n",
    "The order in which the records are ordered does not matter\n",
    "Bonus rule: no column should have hidden values\n",
    "As you can see, the column names in our tables are unique. Every column has only one data type (in our case, all the values are stringsâ€”even the employee IDs are strings). There are no multi-valued cells in the tables. The fourth one gives us the freedom to put the data in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the situation where Jon Doe owned 300 servers, and the server names were all jammed in a single cell? This is not allowed in the first normal form because it makes update operations difficult. The normal form helps prevent such situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The first normal form is considered the least requirement for any data in a relational database. If your data does not even adhere to the first normal form, you have a bad data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second Normal Form (2NF)\n",
    "Before you understand the second normal form, let's explore what dependency is with the help of the following scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an enterprise, it is important that the security updates are installed on every server. This process is known as patching the servers. Typically, updates get installed every month, and at the end of the month, many organizations check the percentage of servers that had been patched during the month. This number is calculated based on how many servers have how many patches in the installed and not required state. This calculation is done per server. Apart from the operating system updates, we would also like to install application updates. Therefore, based on what team we are talking about and what applications they own, the percentage of compliance can change.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine that Microsoft released four updates to the Windows operating system. Citrix Systems, Inc, a multinational software company, released one update to their XenApp. We have the AwesomeFirewall application, provided by Awesomeness, Inc. They released two updates for AwesomeFirewall. Three Windows updates were installed on a server, CXSVR001, and one failed. The XenApp update was installed on the server, but only one of the two updates to AwesomeFirewall was installed on the server and the other failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that instead of individuals owning the servers, the teams own the servers. Let's assume that our organization enforces a compliance percentage on the team leads, saying that every team should have a patch compliance of at least, say, 92% and that the score directly reflects on the person who leads the team. So, let's look at the two tables that we already have, which contain the server and the owner data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the list of servers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3.5: Server list And here are the details about the owners:\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3.6: Owner details  We need to change the way we manage ownership. We need three tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "A table containing the server information\n",
    "A table containing the department information\n",
    "A table containing the employee information\n",
    "Therefore, the revised setup would be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The server information table:\n",
    "Figure 3.7: Server information \n",
    "\n",
    "The employee information table:\n",
    "Figure 3.8: Employee information \n",
    "\n",
    "And finally, the department information table:\n",
    "Figure 3.9: Department information \n",
    "\n",
    "It is now time to establish relationships (given that we have made some drastic changes to the process that are used in tagging servers). Here are the four kinds of relationships we will have:\n",
    "\n",
    "A server may belong to one or more teams (because there can be different aspects of an application, and multiple teams may have ownership over the different aspects).\n",
    "A team can own multiple servers. Obviously, not all the teams can function with just one server.\n",
    "A team can have only one lead.\n",
    "A person can lead only one department (this has been enforced by the management).\n",
    "As a corollary to this, it also means that a team lead can own multiple servers, and each server can be owned by multiple team leads.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the cardinality ratios would be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3.10: Cardinality ratios \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that we created a table for the compliance percentage like so while keeping the patch numbers from the introduction to the second normal form in mind (operating system patches along with the application patches):\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3.11: Compliance percentage \n",
    "\n",
    "How do you calculate the compliance percentage of each server per team? Remember that you need to be able to identify each record (or row) uniquely.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of doing this would be to have a ComplianceId as the primary key, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3.12: Compliance percentage of each server \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, this is the first normal form and complies with all five rules that we listed. However, if you take a look at it, the server name and the department name together form a simpler primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simpler way to handle this would be to use the server name and the department as the primary key for compliance percentageâ€”a composite primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "CXSVR001, in the context of the network team, has a compliance percentage of 66.67%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine, now, that you also add the team lead information to the table:\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3.13: Team lead information added \n",
    "\n",
    "As you may have noticed, LeadId is dependent only on the department, and not the server nameâ€”it is not dependent on the entire primary key. This is partial dependency in database terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must remove this partial dependency if you want your data to be in the second normal form, as per the requirements for the second normal form:\n",
    "\n",
    "The data should be in the first normal form.\n",
    "There should be no partial dependencies in the data.\n",
    "To convert this data into the second normal form, you must get rid of the partial dependency brought in by LeadId. However, what if the patch compliance score is a key performance indicator for each of the leads? What if their yearly bonus depends on this aspect?\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, you need each of the servers to be tagged to the lead. The situation is that the servers belong to departments, not individuals. How do you achieve the second normal form while keeping this in mind?\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the solutions is to alter the Department table to include the lead information:\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3.14: Altered Department table to include lead information \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can remove the LeadId column from the compliance table, and despite not having the LeadId in the table, you can calculate the compliance percentage of each of the leads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third Normal Form (3NF)\n",
    "Consider a situation where a conflict arises between you and your colleague during the calculation of the compliance percentage. Your colleague states, \"Your way of calculating the compliance percentage is flawed! Look, one of Jon's servers gets four updates out of five and the other gets four out of six. You calculate individual servers, say 80% on one and 66.67% on the other. Then, you take an average and say the compliance percentage is 73.33%. Jon had to ensure the installation of 11 patches in all, out of which he installed only eight. His compliance percentage should actually be 72.73%, and not 73.33.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This situation has introduced a different level of complexity in our setup. Now, you need to look for a way to combine several aspects and introduce something that will allow for the calculation of the compliance percentage based on the total patches that are needed for a server per application combination, and the actual score for that combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you get lucky and find out that ESM has a way to combine applications into groups. Therefore, this can provide you with information regarding the total patches per group and the installed patches per group.\n",

    "For data to be in the third normal form:\n",

    "The data should already be in the second normal form.\n",
    "There should be no transitive dependency.\n",
    "Note: Transitive dependency is a form of indirect linking between different attributes. For example, if A depends on B and B depends on C, then there is transitive dependency between A and C.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to convert the data you already have into the third normal form, split all the data into the following four tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "A table that contains server information, called Agent:\n",
    "Figure 3.16: Server information \n",
    "\n",
    "A table that contains employee information, called Employee:\n",

    "You can further normalize data using the Boyce-Codd normal form, the fourth normal form, the fifth normal form, and the sixth normal form as well, but that would make your learning more complex. For now, take on board these three normalizations. Then, as you get more and more comfortable with these three forms, you can proceed to learn about the more advanced normal forms.\n",

    "Denormalization\n",
    "Denormalization of data is another important concept, especially when it comes to querying efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an enterprise, everything is about balance. Most organizations that deal with data do not completely adhere to the complex form of normalization. The reason for this is simple: normalization may kill efficiency when you need to query a large amount of data. Therefore, while we gain in terms of data integrity when normalizing data, we pay a lot in terms of processing power if we ever have to query data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, consider the table in Figure 3.17. If a user has two email addresses, would you have a single column and add both email addresses to it? You could, but that would be non-compliant with the first normal form of data. How do you work around this issue? Create a new table with an employee ID and email address? But then, the employee would have two email addresses and cannot be uniquely identified. Therefore, you would need to add a primary key to that table and with this, the situation becomes much more complex than required.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such a case, you could go for some minor denormalization and add a couple of columns to the existing Employee table, for instance, PrimaryEmail and SecondaryEmail. This way, your queries would be simplified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Denormalization finds most of its use in data warehousing scenariosâ€”situations where you query for a lot of data in a single shot. For instance, if you had to query 200,000 entries, referring to eight tables would consume much more processing power than your systems would support.\n",

    "#THE SELECT STATEMENT\n",
    "Overview\n",
    "This lesson illustrates how to query data from a database, and how we can order them. By the end \n",
    "of this lesson, you will be able to\n",
    "select a specific number of columns, order, and sort results, use naming aliases with the AS clause,\n",
    "filter your search results using the LIMIT and DISTINCT keywords, and combine and use SELECT with \n",
    "mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "So far, whenever we have wanted to see the results, we have used the Select *  syntax either by \n",
    "entering that query directly, or by generating it using the appropriate option in the application's\n",
    "menu. This displayed the entire table. However, when we want to retrieve data from the database, we \n",
    "are often not interested in the entire dataset; we are only looking for specific details. For example,\n",
    "the Packt database contains details of all the books published by Packt. It might include columns such\n",
    "as Book Name , ISBN , Author Name , Author ID , Author Email , Page Count , and Price . But if we wanted\n",
    "to send out a survey to all the authors who have written for Packt, all we would require is the author's name and their email address:\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 4.1: A sample table containing all the details of a book\n",
    "\n",
    "This is all we require:\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 4.2: The required details\n",
    "\n",
    "Queries help us do just this. Using the SELECT  statement, we can pick out specific columns from \n",
    "a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of a typical SQL query is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT [COLUMNS LIST] \n",
    "FROM [TABLE NAME] \n",
    "WHERE [CONDITION] \n",
    "ORDER BY [COLUMN NAME] [ASC|DESC] \n",

    "[COLUMN NAME]  is the column that the result set will be ordered or sorted on.\n",
    "[ASC | DESC]  is the order option, ascending or descending.\n",

    "What Does the SELECT Statement Do?\n",

    "\n",
    "If the output requires all of the columns from the original table, instead of mentioning the entire list of columns, we can use the asterisk sign (*). This acts as a wildcard and selects all the columns in the [TABLE NAME] table specified. We will see some examples of what this means in practice.\n",

    "FROM Customers;\n",
    "The result is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 4.10: Table showing the FirstName and CustomerID columns from the database\n",
    "\n",
    "You can observe that in the FirstName column, there are multiple entries with NULL as their first name. So, when we order our results by FirstName in ascending order and the CustomerID in descending order, we will notice the difference. Let's implement this as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT FirstName, CustomerID\n",
    "FROM Customers\n",
    "ORDER BY FirstName, CustomerID DESC;\n",
    "The result is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 4.11: FirstName in ascending order and CustomerID in descending order\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see in Figure 4.11, it's now sorted alphabetically by FirstName in ascending order, even though we didn't mention the ordering type explicitly in the statement (ASC being the default order). Where there are multiple entries in the name column that are the same (NULL), these are then sorted in descending order by ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: NULL is used to represent an empty or missing value. For this reason, NULL appears at the top of the sorted list in the output, rather than being sorted alphabetically according to the letter N.\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful tip when using the ORDER BY clause is to use an integer abbreviation instead of the complete column name. Column abbreviations start with 1, which is given to the first column in your statement. 2 is given to the second column, and so on. Let's try to perform the same query as before, but we will now order the columns using their abbreviations and, this time, the second ordering column will be sorted in ascending order instead:\n",

We will also create views using queries that allows us the flexibility to create a temporary table to run queries on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "In the previous chapter, we saw how the various types of SQL joins can connect multiple tables in a single SELECT query. This powerful technique gives us fine-grained control over the data that our SQL queries return. However, SQL offers much more. In this chapter, we'll use the PACKT_ONLINE_SHOP database to see how subqueries, CASE statements, and views boost the flexibility and power of SQL in an efficient, intuitive way. Like joins, subqueries can relate different tables together in the same SQL query, but compared to queries involving multiple outer joins and unions, subqueries can offer a simpler, cleaner query structure. This can make the development and maintenance of the code easier. CASE statements offer a clean, efficient way for a query to handle decisions, depending on the defined conditions that occur in the query. Views provide an efficient, effective way to group multiple tables together in a symbolic table that's available for use by other queries. In this chapter, we will look at each concept in detail.\n",

    "Subqueries\n",
    "In a SQL statement, a subquery operates like a joined table. It gathers data in a structured way and makes that data available for its outer SQL query. Placed in parentheses, a subquery, or an inner query, nests inside a parent, or an outer query. A subquery can nest in the following clauses of the parent query or another subquery:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "WHERE\n",
    "A lot of the power of SQL products comes from their ability to link different tables in a single query. As we have seen already, we can link tables with inner and outer joins. In a query, we can also use a subquery to relate data from different tables. We can easily use the result of a subquery in the parent query without dealing with a join. Although queries with joins often have better performance, a subquery structure can seem a little more intuitive at first glance. Additionally, it's always good to have another option available when we build our queries. Both MySQL and SQL Server handle subqueries. Although a SQL subquery is a complete, standalone SQL statement here, we'll focus on subqueries that return only one column to avoid unneeded complexity as we explore the concept of subqueries. A subquery can certainly return two or more columns, but if the outer query expects only one column, the subquery must return only one column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a Packt manager wants a list of products that have zero sales. The Products and OrderItems tables probably have the information we need because OrderItems ties specific products to specific orders. Using what we've learned about SQL joins, we can build a query to answer this question:\n",
    "\n",
    "USE      packt_online_shop; \n",

    "ON       Products.ProductID = OrderItems.ProductID \n",
    "WHERE    OrderItems.ProductID IS NULL \n",
    "ORDER BY Products.ProductID; \n",
    "The result will be as follows:Figure 7.1: A SQL Server OUTER JOIN query\n",
    "\n",
    "In this query, we placed the Products table columns we wanted in the SELECT clause. The LEFT OUTER JOIN matches the rows between the Products and OrderItems tables. The LEFT OUTER JOIN also combines those rows with the Products table rows that don't match the OrderItems table rows. Although an inner join would match those rows, an inner join will miss Products table rows that have no OrderItems table matches. In the WHERE clause, IS NULL filtered out the rows from the Products table that have a matching row in the OrderItems table. This makes sense because we want the Products table rows that don't appear in the OrderItems table. The ORDER BY clause sorts the result set by ProductID. We can also solve this problem with a subquery\n",

For example, we may need a SELECT query column that shows different values based on different, specific values or conditions that have been found in a specific database table column. We'll see an illustration of this in the next paragraph. A SQL CASE statement will step through a list of conditions and then return a result based on the first matching condition it finds. The CASE statements work in the SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, WHERE, and HAVING clauses, and they operate a lot like simple IFâ€¦ELSE statements.

    "Views\n",
    "As a business grows, its financial management and reporting needs will probably grow as well. Management will turn to the database for answers. Every database query will be different, but eventually, it will become clear that the same, or very similar, SELECT statements seem to come up again and again. The same SELECT statement could show up in a subquery, or maybe in a stored procedure, which is something we'll learn about soon. That statement could become really complicated, with a lot of tables, outer joins, CASE statements of its own. If we could somehow save that SELECT statement and then use it like a table as a basis for other SQL statements and queries, we could save a lot of time and effort. SQL views will help solve this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL views can encapsulate complex queries, exposing the columns in a much cleaner way for use by other queries. In other words, a view can join multiple tables together in a defined, structured way, and substitute all of that complexity with a view name that operates just like a table name. Views can also limit access to their component tables, which increases security. We can assign access to a view to different users in a secure, granular way. Additionally, a SQL view can make database maintenance easier if different queries and resources throughout the database use that view.\n",
    "\n",
    "One change in one view could save us having to make the same changes in potentially hundreds of other database queries. Note, however, that we should avoid UPDATE operations with views because the security aspects of even simple views can make this really difficult, and views of even moderate complexity won't support updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a SQL view as a predefined SELECT statement with one or more tables, and at least one column from one table. A view returns only table columns. Once defined, other SQL queries and statements can use that view as another table. A SQL view can isolate tables and columns securely, thus exposing only those data resources that other stakeholders may need. Additionally, if multiple database resources use the same view and the tables behind the view change, we would only need to change the view itself, that is, in a one-to-many way. Nothing that relies on the view would have to change. Without a view, we would have to change each of those resources, which would become a major pain point.

    "Programming for SQL Products â€“ The Basics\n",
    "MySQL programming, like all programming and software development, relies on a small set of core ideas. Variables are an important part of that idea set, and we'll see how they work as we begin to work with MySQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we build programs in MySQL or in any other software development language, we use variables as buckets to hold information, or values, that the programs need. A variable has a name, and in most software productsâ€”including MySQLâ€”it has an information type. In a structured, predictable way, the program can change the value of a variable based on the behavior of the program, information that comes into the program from outside of the program, or both. A variable will reliably hold the last value assigned to it. Before we look at SQL stored procedures and functions, we'll see how variables operate in MySQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Launch MySQL and place the following statements in the editor or the query window:\n",
    "\n",
    "SET @var1 = NULL;      -- 1. Declare variable @var1 \n",
    "SELECT @var1;          -- 2. Output the value of @var1 \n",
    "SET @var1 = 3;         -- 3. Set @var1 to 3 \n",
    "SELECT @var1;          -- 4. Output the value of @var1 \n",
    "SET @var1 = @var1 - 7; -- 5. Subtract 7 from @var1 \n",
    "SELECT @var1;          -- 6. Output the value of @var1 \n",
    "SET @var1 = @var1 + 5; -- 7. Add 5 to @var1 \n",
    "SELECT @var1;          -- 8. Output the value of @var1 \n",
    "In each line, the text after the two consecutive hyphen characters, --, will not execute as they are comments. We can place the two consecutive hyphen characters anywhere, as shown here. These characters work the same way in a stored procedure. Therefore, we have to be careful with them because, in the middle of a stored procedure statement, they could lead to an error because SQL will ignore these characters and everything after them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use this feature to write comments in the programs we build. Comments help explain how programs work. Although this example has short, simple comments, all the software we build should include detailed, descriptive comments to explain its development history, important engineering ideas, and so on to help later programmersâ€”including youâ€”understand how it works. Let's look at what each line states:\n",
    "\n",
    "Line 1 shows the first use of the @var1 variable in this set of MySQL statements. MySQL does not require special statements, data types, or code to initially declare a variable; the first use of a variable is enough. To assign a value to a variable, MySQL expects the SET keyword, then the variable name, an equals sign, and then the actual value itself. Always prefix the variable name with the @ symbol, every time you use that variable. When we place a variable name with SET on the left of an equal sign, as seen in lines 1, 3, 5, and 7, MySQL expects that statement to assign a value, even NULL, to that variable. For example, line 1 assigns NULL to @var1.\n",
    "Line 2 uses the SELECT keyword, which we saw earlier in this course, to output the latest value of @var1.\n",
    "Line 3 assigns a non-null value to @var1.\n",
    "Line 4 outputs that value.\n",
    "Line 5 subtracts 7 from @var1, changing its value in a predictable way.\n",
    "Line 6 once again outputs the latest value of @var1.\n",
    "Line 7 adds 5 to @var1.\n",
    "Line 8 outputs the latest @var1 value.\n",
    "MySQL requires a semicolon at the end of every statement of a stored procedure, a function, and a trigger. To see how these statement looks like In MYSQL, refer Figure 8.1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 8.1: MySQL statements\n",

    "\n",
    "When we declared the @var1 variable, we assigned a NULL value to it. MySQL does not necessarily see this as wrong, at least in this example. However, keep in mind that it can cause problems as you build SQL programs. This happens because MySQL, a program that depends on the data MySQL returns, or both, may expect a non-null value at certain points.\n",
    "\n",
    "MySQL allows us to highlight, or paint, specific lines in the programs we build for fine-grained control of the lines we execute. Depending on the specific situation, sometimes the highlighted code will work, and sometimes it won't. To execute this correctly, all the highlighted code must be correct because it must all work in one batch.\n",
    "\n",

    "Stored Procedures\n",
    "MySQL defines a group of one or more SQL statements as a stored procedure, and this definition extends to other database products. A stored procedure has features that are similar to those of other programming languages and technologies. A stored procedure can easily accept input values from other stored procedures and even other programs. A university database system, for example, may rely on a stored procedureâ€”probably many inter-related stored proceduresâ€”to efficiently and reliably calculate the current tuition balances at any time for one, some, or all of its students. The overall calculation will probably become complex, in part because it will pull data from many different tables. If the developers use stored procedures to build the solution, both the development process and the solution they build will become much more efficient, reliable, maintainable, and secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stored procedures offer huge benefits. A stored procedure can gather complex SQL statements and queries into one package that returns consistent results and behaves in consistent ways each time we execute or call it. With proper configuration, external programs and applications can execute stored procedures in a clean, reliable way, and stored procedures can return result sets to the programs that call them in a structured, dependable way. Stored procedures have great flexibility because they use key concepts of programming and software development, as we'll see. A stored procedure can return, update, and delete table data. A stored procedure can call other stored procedures. In addition, SQL products compile stored procedure code, which optimizes its performance and scalability, even for solutions with heavy traffic volumes. This aspect of stored procedures enhances security because compilation converts the stored procedure code into machine code, which is difficult to read. A university administration department, for example, may use stored procedures in its database system because stored procedures offer an ideal way to translate complex business rules into clean, efficient, maintainable programs.\n",

    "The complexity of the software we build expands as we build it. In part, this becomes unavoidable because the mass of the software itself also expands. However, we can definitely avoid the complexity of repeating blocks of code. Modern software development products give us a way to place one copy of a repeating block of code in one defined location. Then, in the software, we can replace all repeated instances of that code block with a call to that one defined copy of the code. We call this one defined block of software a function. Think of a function as a box that takes in zero or more values and returns one or more values in a structured way. A function simplifies software, and it makes the software we build much easier to maintain, repair, and enhance. If a program has the same identical code block repeated one hundred times, the same required change to all of those blocks would require the same workâ€”and testingâ€”one hundred times. If we replace those blocks with one hundred calls to a single function, and in some way call the function when and where we need it, we can change and test the function code in one location. This would instantly give us a incredibly huge saving in time, effort, and expense. MySQL offers built-in functions that we can directly call in the Workbench query windows and in the stored procedures we build.

For example, we could easily build MySQL functions that calculate the number of hours between the time of function execution and the first second of January 1 of that year. These functions could have major value for finance, insurance, and inventory management applications. SQL functions offer many of the advantages of SQL stored procedures as described earlier, but a function does not offer the exact same advantages and flexibility. Functions can't update or delete table data. Functions can't call stored procedures. Additionally, external programs and applications can't call a SQL function as easily.\n",

This makes sense because every order has at least one ordered item. Also, an order will map to one customer. In a similar way, a payment in that database will insert a new row in the Payments table. The payment will map to a specific order because every payment has an OrderID value. Since every OrderID value maps to a specific customer, a payment will indirectly map to a customer.

The running balance covers all payments and all order item charges. Insert triggers on both the Payments and OrderItems tables can calculate the customer running balances. Because a trigger resembles a stored procedure, a trigger on one PACKT_ONLINE_SHOP database table can see all the tables in the database, including the Payments and OrderItems tables. This way, a PACKT_ONLINE_SHOP trigger can see all the information it would need to calculate the customer running balances. We need a trigger on the OrderItems table that will calculate a customer's running balance every time the customer adds an order item in the OrderItems table. That trigger should automatically update the Customers.BalanceNotes column with the running balance calculation result for that customer.

    "Lines 29 through 34 declare the variables that the trigger code needs. The line 39 SELECT statement retrieves the OrderID value from the INSERTED table and then assigns that value to the orderIDVal variable. This technique uses a feature of MySQL triggers. When MySQL inserts a row into a table, another table called NEW receives an exact copy of that inserted row. This copy clones all the data of the original inserted row, and that cloned data has data types that match the original data. The NEW table supports only SELECT queries, and only INSERT and UPDATE triggers can access the NEW table. A DELETE trigger has a similar OLD table, which holds an exact copy of the DELETED row, with similar matching data types and visibility restrictionsâ€”only DELETE triggers can access the OLD table. A MySQL UPDATE trigger does not have a dedicated UPDATED table. Instead, an UPDATE trigger can look for data changes in the NEW and OLD tables to see which row columns changed, and how they changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The line 39 SET statement finds the orderID value mapped to the new order and sets the orderIDVal variable to that orderID value. In a similar way, line 43 finds the customerID value mapped to the order and sets the customerID variable to that customerID value. Line 51 calculates the current order balance value for the customer, assigning the value to the orderBalance variable. Line 60 calculates the current payment balance value for the customer, assigning the value to the paymentBalance variable. Line 69 adds these values for the runningTotal variable. Later string operations in this trigger will need this balance total value in a string format, so line 34 declared the runningTotal variable with a VARCHAR data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lines 75 through 94 build a string that shows the latest running total for the customer. The CONCAT string function assembles the data into a finished string. We'll see more about string functions later. On line 93, the DATE_FORMAT function converts the NOW() datestamp function value to a \"Jan 1, 2006\" format.

    "When we build programs in MySQL or in any other software development language, we use variables as buckets to hold information, or values, that the programs need. A variable has a name, and in most software productsâ€”including MySQLâ€”it has an information type. In a structured, predictable way, the program can change the value of a variable based on the behavior of the program, information that comes into the program from outside of the program, or both.

    "Line 1 shows the first use of the @var1 variable in this set of MySQL statements. MySQL does not require special statements, data types, or code to initially declare a variable; the first use of a variable is enough. To assign a value to a variable, MySQL expects the SET keyword, then the variable name, an equals sign, and then the actual value itself. Always prefix the variable name with the @ symbol, every time you use that variable. When we place a variable name with SET on the left of an equal sign, as seen in lines 1, 3, 5, and 7, MySQL expects that statement to assign a value, even NULL, to that variable. For example, line 1 assigns NULL to @var1.\n",

    "Stored Procedures\n",
    "MySQL defines a group of one or more SQL statements as a stored procedure, and this definition extends to other database products. A stored procedure has features that are similar to those of other programming languages and technologies. A stored procedure can easily accept input values from other stored procedures and even other programs. A university database system, for example, may rely on a stored procedureâ€”probably many inter-related stored proceduresâ€”to efficiently and reliably calculate the current tuition balances at any time for one, some, or all of its students. The overall calculation will probably become complex, in part because it will pull data from many different tables. If the developers use stored procedures to build the solution, both the development process and the solution they build will become much more efficient, reliable, maintainable, and secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stored procedures offer huge benefits. A stored procedure can gather complex SQL statements and queries into one package that returns consistent results and behaves in consistent ways each time we execute or call it. With proper configuration, external programs and applications can execute stored procedures in a clean, reliable way, and stored procedures can return result sets to the programs that call them in a structured, dependable way. Stored procedures have great flexibility because they use key concepts of programming and software development, as we'll see. A stored procedure can return, update, and delete table data. A stored procedure can call other stored procedures. In addition, SQL products compile stored procedure code, which optimizes its performance and scalability, even for solutions with heavy traffic volumes. This aspect of stored procedures enhances security because compilation converts the stored procedure code into machine code, which is difficult to read. A university administration department, for example, may use stored procedures in its database system because stored procedures offer an ideal way to translate complex business rules into clean, efficient, maintainable programs.\n",

    "The complexity of the software we build expands as we build it. In part, this becomes unavoidable because the mass of the software itself also expands. However, we can definitely avoid the complexity of repeating blocks of code. Modern software development products give us a way to place one copy of a repeating block of code in one defined location. Then, in the software, we can replace all repeated instances of that code block with a call to that one defined copy of the code. We call this one defined block of software a function. Think of a function as a box that takes in zero or more values and returns one or more values in a structured way. A function simplifies software, and it makes the software we build much easier to maintain, repair, and enhance. If a program has the same identical code block repeated one hundred times, the same required change to all of those blocks would require the same workâ€”and testingâ€”one hundred times. If we replace those blocks with one hundred calls to a single function, and in some way call the function when and where we need it, we can change and test the function code in one location. This would instantly give us a incredibly huge saving in time, effort, and expense.

These functions could have major value for finance, insurance, and inventory management applications. SQL functions offer many of the advantages of SQL stored procedures as described earlier, but a function does not offer the exact same advantages and flexibility.

This makes sense because every order has at least one ordered item. Also, an order will map to one customer. In a similar way, a payment in that database will insert a new row in the Payments table.

Because a trigger resembles a stored procedure, a trigger on one PACKT_ONLINE_SHOP database table can see all the tables in the database, including the Payments and OrderItems tables. This way, a PACKT_ONLINE_SHOP trigger can see all the information it would need to calculate the customer running balances. We need a trigger on the OrderItems table that will calculate a customer's running balance every time the customer adds an order item in the OrderItems table.

    "In this chapter, we learned that SQL aggregate functions provide an efficient, flexible way to calculate summary values in SQL query result sets. We discovered that the GROUP BY clause will separate the results of a SELECT query into one or more row groups to support the design and execution of queries with aggregate functions. We saw that the HAVING clause provides a pinpoint way to filter aggregate function calculations. Although they're similar, we learned about the differences between WHERE and HAVING clauses. Finally, we saw that when we use OVER and PARTITION BY in creative ways, MySQL will efficiently expand the range of problems it can solve for us. We can also order the items with a group using the RANK and DENSE RANK functions. In the next chapter, we will look at some advanced features of SQL programming.\n",

    "String Functions\n",
    "In the previous chapters, we saw that text or string data is an important part of real-world database resources. SQL database products offer dedicated functions to handle and manipulate string data. As we'll see, this makes them useful in a SELECT clause. In addition, although the LIKE operator is not a string function, it searches for string patterns in other strings. This makes it incredibly useful in a WHERE clause. We'll see this as well. Since we can use string functions in SELECT statements and WHERE clauses, we can also use them in stored procedures, user-defined functions, and triggers.\n",
    "\n",
    "One example of a string function is the UPPER function. This function converts a string value into all uppercase characters. Consider the following query:\n",
    "\n",
    "USE packt_online_shop;\n",
    "SELECT ProductID, ProductName, UPPER(ProductName) AS'UPPER CASE PRODUCT NAME'\n",
    "FROM Products;\n",
    "Running the preceding code in the SQL query window yields the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 11.1: The SQL Server UPPER string function\n",
    "In the SELECT clause, the UPPER function converted all the ProductName column characters in all the rows into uppercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "In MySQL, you can convert a numeric value into a textual representation of it by using CAST function:\n",
    "\n",
    "CAST( numeric_float_value AS CHAR|VARCHAR)\n",
    "Depending on the values it receives, it can round and even truncate its return values. Now, consider another example query:\n",
    "\n",
    "USE packt_online_shop;\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT OrderItemID, Quantity, UnitPrice,\n",
    "  CAST((Quantity * UnitPrice) AS CHAR) AS 'Quantity * UnitPrice'\n",
    "FROM OrderItems;\n",
    "The preceding query will now give the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 11.2: The MySQL STR string function\n",
    "The second STR function parameter sets the return value's total length to 10, while the third parameter sets the number of decimal places to the right of the decimal point to two. The query returned the calculated values we need, but most of those values have a lot of blank spaces because the STR function added extra spaces to fill the string length to 10. For example, in row five, the last column has six extra spaces in front of the value. The SQL Server LTRIM function removes or trims leading spaces from a string, while the RTRIM function removes or trims trailing spaces from a string. We can nest these functions to remove all leading and trailing spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: SQL Server 2017 offers a TRIM function that clones these nested functions and puts them in one function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the code we can use to remove all leading and trailing spaces:\n",

    "USE packt_online_shop;\n",

To make the same changes using a transaction, the query would be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "USE PACKT_ONLINE_SHOP; \n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT ProductID, Availablequantity \n",
    "FROM Products \n",
    "WHERE Productid = 3; \n",

    "SET AvailableQuantity = 150 -- Original value = 1000 \n",
    "WHERE ProductID = 3; \n",
    "\n",
    "-- COMMIT; \n",
    "ROLLBACK; \n",
    "Before the transaction, the query would lead to the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 11.16: Usage of TRANSACTION\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to execute, and then reverse, the UPDATE statement. START TRANSACTION is the statement that begins the transaction block. To close off the TRANSACTION block, we can use either the COMMIT statement to lock it in, or ROLLBACK the transaction to reverse it. All transactions will have the START TRANSACTION statement. The structure seen here uses transactions flexibility in a safe way, and we'll see why we commented out the COMMIT statement shortly. We can see the changes that were made to the data at any time with the SELECT statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "To effectively use this transaction structure, highlight and run the statements one at a time. First, highlight and run the START TRANSACTION statement to begin the transaction. Then, highlight and run the UPDATE statement. Highlight and run SELECT query to see the data change. You will obtain the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 11.17: A  transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "To ROLLBACK that change, highlight and run the ROLLBACK query. The output is shown here:\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 11.18: Rolling back a transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the final two lines in the code makes it easy to reverse the change if the transaction is open. To COMMIT the transaction, highlight and run the COMMIT statement after the -- comment symbols, as shown here:\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 11.19: Committing a MySQL transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Those symbols make it difficult to COMMIT the transaction, and the structure makes it easy to reverse the transaction with ROLLBACK. This structure forces us to think through and verify what we do as we make the changes. Make sure to balance every BEGIN TRANSACTION execution with either a COMMIT or a ROLLBACK. An unbalanced BEGIN TRANSACTION will cause problems with the SQL Server instance itself. We can run ROLLBACK TRANSACTION as many times as we want, although it will return a message for each unbalanced ROLLBACK TRANSACTION statement, as shown here:\n",

As we learned in this topic, this chapter, and throughout this course, we must use extreme care when we work with data resources.
